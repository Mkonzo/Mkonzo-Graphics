Mkonzo-Graphics

A creative graphics showcase and portfolio built with web technologies.

🚀 Project Overview

Mkonzo-Graphics is a front-end project that demonstrates graphics and design work through an interactive web page. Built with HTML, CSS and optional JavaScript components, it serves as both a portfolio piece and a playground for visual expression.

🧩 Key Features

Clean, responsive layout to present graphic designs and visual content.

Easy to host via GitHub Pages or any static-site host.

Simple structure: Index.html is the entry point, with supporting assets (images, CSS, JS).

Ideal for showcasing graphic design work, creative experiments, or web-based visual storytelling.

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic markup and structure

CSS3 – styling and responsive design (flexbox / grid)

(Optional) JavaScript – for interactive or animated elements

(Optional) Static hosting via GitHub Pages or similar
